# Miniproject follow-up post

## User Story
As a reader of the original persistent memory post, I want to understand how miniproject evolved so that I can apply the workflow and artifact model to real projects.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Post explains artifact types with intent vs real usage.
- [ ] Post explains workflow and step transitions.
- [ ] Post explains why tasks are files.
- [ ] Post includes practical command examples.

## Context
Follow-up to 2025-12-13 post.

## Out of Scope
- Full command reference
- Deep dive into implementation internals

## Tasks
- [ ] .memory/task-9d12ab44-outline-miniproject-followup.md
- [ ] .memory/task-4f8a0d13-draft-miniproject-followup.md

## Notes
Interview answers from 2026-02-20 session are the primary source.
