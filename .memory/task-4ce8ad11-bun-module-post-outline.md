## Steps
1. Define core concepts:
   - Fast package bootstrap with setup script
   - Tooling baseline (TypeScript + mise + lint/test)
   - Release flow with release-please channels
   - First publish + trusted publishing caveat
2. Map concepts into start/middle/end structure.
3. Plan representation mix:
   - Checklist
   - Story sequence
   - nomnoml diagram

## Expected Outcome
Clear structure and content plan for drafting.

## Actual Outcome
Outline completed and used directly in the final draft.

## Lessons Learned
Keeping the post scoped to concrete steps prevents template posts from becoming generic marketing copy.
