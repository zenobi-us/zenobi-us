# Draft bun-module post

## Objective
Write and save the post in `content/posts/` with repository-aligned style.

## Related Story
- [story-9bf42d10-bun-module-post-intent.md](./story-9bf42d10-bun-module-post-intent.md)

## Steps
1. Draft TL;DR and practical audience framing.
2. Add setup walkthrough and release caveats.
3. Add representation mix items and summary.
4. Save post with date-based filename.
5. Run typecheck as baseline verification.

## Expected Outcome
A publish-ready draft post exists and passes basic repository validation.

## Actual Outcome
Draft completed in `content/posts/2026-02-19-bun-module-practical-template-for-bun-packages.md`.

## Lessons Learned
The most useful guidance is operational sequence and release gotchas, not broad tool comparisons.
