# Explain bun-module as a practical starter for Bun packages

## User Story
As a developer starting a new package, I want a clear walkthrough of `zenobi-us/bun-module` so that I can scaffold fast and avoid release workflow mistakes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Post explains what the template includes.
- [x] Post shows setup flow (`Use template` → `setup.sh` → `develop`).
- [x] Post highlights release model and first-publish caveat.
- [x] Post uses at least two representation modes.

## Context
The template includes Bun+TypeScript scaffolding, mise tasks, and release-please automation. A post should turn this into practical guidance.

## Out of Scope
- Deep internal implementation of release-please internals
- General Bun tutorial unrelated to this template

## Tasks
- [task-4ce8ad11-bun-module-post-outline.md](./task-4ce8ad11-bun-module-post-outline.md)
- [task-6a9f0c22-bun-module-post-draft.md](./task-6a9f0c22-bun-module-post-draft.md)

## Notes
Facts sourced from `README.md` in `zenobi-us/bun-module` (main branch).
