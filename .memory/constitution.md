# Project Constitution

## Project Rules

### Planning First
- Define an epic before creating phases, stories, or tasks.
- Keep scope tied to the current active epic.

### Memory Store Hygiene
- Keep `.memory/summary.md`, `.memory/todo.md`, and `.memory/team.md` current.
- Capture architecture and flow updates in `knowledge-*.md` files.

### Human Review Gates
- Require human review after phase planning before task breakdown.
- Require human review before epic archival.

### Change Control
- Use conventional commits for memory changes.
- Never push changes without explicit human review.
