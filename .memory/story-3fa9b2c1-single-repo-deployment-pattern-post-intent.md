# Single repo deployment pattern post intent

## User Story
As an engineer shipping single-repo libs/apps, I want a practical deployment pattern so I can automate releases without unnecessary process overhead.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Post explains why release-please is preferred over changesets for single repos.
- [x] Post explains why release and deploy workflows are separated.
- [x] Post explains manual dispatch value for deploy recovery.
- [x] Post explains why mise replaces package.json scripts.
- [x] Post includes a practical workflow sketch and implementation guidance.

## Context
User requested a post capturing a newly settled deployment pattern.

## Out of Scope
- Deep monorepo release strategy comparison
- Full GitHub Actions cookbook

## Tasks
- [x] .memory/task-8ac2d5e0-single-repo-deployment-outline.md
- [x] .memory/task-b7f31a9d-single-repo-deployment-draft.md

## Notes
Tone should be opinionated and practical, matching existing zenobi.us posts.
